I'm happy a friend decided to start with the challenges of HackThisSite after he read some of the posts I've been writing! I think I will continue with this because it is not only a way for me to remember the solutions to some of this challenges but I also think that some of you may want to give them a try.

This time we're told that security of the email system has improved. Let's check it.

## Requisites

Nothing new. If you were able to complete the previous task, this should be familiar.


## Solution

You must hover the hints for them to show so not to spoil people only reading the requisites section:

<h3 class="spoiler">Hint 1: <span>Have a look at challenge number 4...</span></h3>
<h3 class="spoiler">Hint 2: <span>Have a look at challenge number 4.</span></h3>
<h3 class="spoiler">Hint 3: <span>Have a look at challenge number 4 :)</span></h3>
<h3 class="spoiler">Solution: <span>Have a look at challenge number 4!</span></h3>


## Thoughts

Yes, this can happen... Sometimes we're told that a problem has been fixed but partial fixes can happen... A clear example can be [Apple's Shellshock patch](http://www.cnet.com/news/apples-shellshock-patch-incomplete-say-experts/) that didn't fix the problem completely. I'm sure you could find many other examples!
