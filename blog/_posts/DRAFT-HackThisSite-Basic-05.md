I'm happy some friends decided to start with the challenges of HackThisSite after they read some of the posts I've been writing! I think I will continue with this because it is not only a way for me to remember the solutions to some of this challenges but I also think that some of you may want to give them a try.

This time we're told that security of the email system has improved. Let's check it.

Nothing new. If you were able to complete the previous task, this should be familiar.

## Thoughts

Yes, this can happen... Sometimes we're told that a problem has been fixed but partial fixes can happen... A clear example can be [Apple's Shellshock patch](http://www.cnet.com/news/apples-shellshock-patch-incomplete-say-experts/) that didn't fix the problem completely. I'm sure you could find many other examples!
