We're used to interact with devices through a screen and a keyboard. They are very practical and easy to use interfaces but sometimes can be too expensive for some devices to include them. Embeded devices like routers 
simply don't need a graphical interface and we sometimes forget that ethernet or wifi are not the only access vectors that can be used to pentest this kind of devices.

Almost evey embeded device includes an UART port that gives access to a lot of useful information when looking for vulnerabilities. This type of ports are commonly hidden by the device case, but once opened, they're 
usually easy to locate.
