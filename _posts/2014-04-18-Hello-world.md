I'm an engineering undergraduate born in a [small town called Chantada](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chantada), that likes electronics and computer and if you ask me, I'm specially interested in the security area 
and in robotics.  

I would like to use this blog to share some of my experiences and specially the knowledge that I found difficult to locate on the net or that really helped me getting introduced into particular topics like embeded 
device security.  

I think you will find usefull some of my projects and interests and I hope you can learn from my experience the same way I expect learning from your opinions and comments. I would like to see a lot of feedback and/or 
any questions you think I might be able to solve in my mailbox (<antoniovazquezblanco@gmail.com>) or in comments (not implemented yet in this blog...).
