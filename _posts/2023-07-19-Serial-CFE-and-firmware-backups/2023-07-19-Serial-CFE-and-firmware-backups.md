## About the serial port...

I've got my hands on a TP-Link Archer C1200 v2 router and I cannot avoid tinkering with it...

As soon as I got it I offered to bring it to a small hacking gathering we organized after work so that my colleages could play with it. It turned out that many of them never tryed to locate an UART port nor soldered before... Less than an hour later a group of happy new hardware hackers had a root shell via serial :). As it turned out, the port was extremely easy to locate and solder. The only thing we may have asked for is for TP-Link to label the port.

Here is a photo of the main router board...

Here is the detail of the serial port connections...

For those interested, you can find more info on how to locate a serial port on [this older article](/2015/05/10/UART-and-Serial-ports.html) and the info on this particular serial port location uploaded to [OpenWRT wiki](https://openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer_c1200_v2#serial).

## CFE

I was thinking that if I wanted to further tinker with the device I would need to back the flash of the device.

The serial port brought up a root shell after fully booting and started thinking about how could I `hexdump -x /dev/mtd*` but, if I brick it then how would I dump this back... Not good enought... I prefer bootloader stuff...

While de device was open, we took notes on the chips in the main board. This is a broadcom based device. Quick and dirty google search shows that Broadcom commonly uses a bootloader called `CFE` for their devices. It is also quite common to use `Ctrl+C` as the key to interrupt the booting process and to enter the bootloader. A couple of attempts later and voilÃ ...

## Backing up the firmware...

Using the show devices command of the bootloader, it seems that there are two devices but oddly mapped into the same offsets...

```

Just in case, let's try to dump all... The command I used to dump the different devices/partitions is:
```
fdump -offset=0x00000000 -size=0x01000000 flash0
```

Unfortunatelly, trying to dump flash1 throws an error:
```
CFE> fdump -offset=0x00000000 -size=0x01000000 flash1
flash1: Device not found
*** command status = -6
```

Anyways, after launching the dump command go and have some sleep... It will take a while to dump 16MB in a 115200 baud connection...

After the nap, you can convert the text dumps into binary files by running the following command:
```
grep -E "^[0-9a-f]+  " flash0.txt | cut -d' ' -f3-18 | xxd -r -p > flash0.bin
```

It may be interesting to have the different sections split into different files in case I just need to flash back a single block to avoid waiting so much...

To flash a block back to the device we may use the flash command avaiable in CFE:

```
flash -noheader 192.168.0.100:flash0.trx.bin flash0.trx
```
